For awhile I've been musing about writing up a collection of first principles for software development, based on what I've read/learned.

Given that I anticipate these principles being a continual WIP, instead of a blog post, I'm just making a page for it [here](/pages/first-principles.html) and will post small blog updates if/when I make major edits to the content.
