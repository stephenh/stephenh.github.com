title: Moving to GitHub Pages
---

WordPress sucks for including code examples. And bulleted lists. And authoring in Opera. So, I'm going with a GitHub page based on:

http://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com/tree/master

It's cool stuff. No ability to comment, but I don't get a lot of those anyway. Just email me instead.
