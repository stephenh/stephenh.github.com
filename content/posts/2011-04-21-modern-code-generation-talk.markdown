title: Modern Code Generation Talk
---


I did a talk this week for the local [JUG](http://www.ojug.org) on Modern Code Generation.

My main assertion is that old-school, generating-`.java`-file code generation has been out of favor by the community for fancier alternatives (runtime CGLIB/ASM bytecode generation), and this isn't necessarily a good thing.

Unlike my usual talks, I actually prepared for this one, and ended up with:

* A [slide show](https://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=0AQJbluyXBq3ZZGQ0dDRuemtfMWZ3ZmN2bmNy&hl=en&authkey=COrBsM8I) (tada!), and

* Several [example projects](http://github.com/stephenh/modern-code-generation) on github

The discussion during the talk was lively (always a good sign), and even wandered into discussing whether Java's static typing inherently leads to the boilerplate common on many Java projects.

All in all, a lot of fun. Always curious why more professional programmers don't go to/talk at these sort of things.
