title: Open vs. Closed systems
---

* Glue vs. a platform

* Every entity in the system comes from the same data source
  * Pro: consistent, automated mapping
  * Con: hard to optimized entities for specific use cases


Sales force closed
Closed simple, One datadbase, uniform mapping, cathedral
Open, each is different, more work, more flexibility, more evolution 

Generic entity, people/place/thing. Less freedom to optimize entities as needed
