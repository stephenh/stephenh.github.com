==============

* I prefer to depend on smaller, simpler upstream projects, rather than the most popular.

* Every time I've gotten burned by a technology, it's because it is too big and complicated to change/fork, e.g. Hibernate, GWT, Ivy

* BMP is 3 years old. Most 3 year old codebases in this industry really suck. The choices I make are to, in 6 months, in 6 years, have it not suck.
