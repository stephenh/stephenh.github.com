==============

There has been a lot of kibitzing about recent acquisitions of startups primarily for their teams ([here](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4274505), [here](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4271376), [here](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4272423), etc.).

I have two gripes with these sort of acquisitions, both admittedly from the standpoint of being a salaried/"just a dev" developer:

Acquihires Reward the Wrong People
----------------------------------

When I'm a salaried developer, I don't expect to earn the same compensation as founders or VCs. Both groups, founders and VCs, have risked putting their resources into the company, betting that the company's business model will be successful.

But in acquihires, the company is basically admitting the business model, which the founders/VCs bet upon, is a failure. And that the team, those salaried developers, is now worth more than the business's original ambitious market/revenue goals.

...but the VCs and founders are still compensated disproportionately more than the regular, salaried team, even though it's the team itself that is now more valuable than the original business.

Granted, the founder/VC compensation is not their hoped 10x/IPO return, and I do not have any inside information on these deals, but I can generally assume it's a) non-zero and b) more than what an employee with options is getting from their options/hiring bonus.

The founders and VCs basically collect non-trivial compensation for being wrong about their original business model, and instead being glorified recruiters.

So, while it's not what they were hoping for, I still think it's hypocritical for founders/VCs to earn a disproportionately larger reward for their failed business venture than the now-more-valuable team.

Acquiring Companies Have Double Standards
-----------------------------------------

I am not an expert on acquihires, but I've heard the rule of thumb is ~$1 million per acquired engineer. E.g. if you have a team of 20, the ballpark for a "talent only please" acquisition is ~$20 million.

My gripe is that, if these engineers had individually approached the acquiring company, they would have no hope of personally getting a $1 million signing bonus/stock plan.

Again, not that I am an expert, but my impression is that if an individual developer approaches one of these big companies, especially post-IPO ones like Google, you'll be talking to their regular recruiters who have standard package offers with healthy-but-not-$1-million incentives/bonuses/etc.

I know the common assertion is, by hiring an existing, "gelled" team, an acquiring company is getting something more valuable than the individuals are themselves of their own accord, hence being able to justify a higher per-engineer cost.

But I'm not sure this is the case--since this is an acquihire, the product is being shutdown, so these 20 engineers will now have to be reassigned within the parent company, and I just can't see them all ending up on the same team in the same roles such that they could continue to leverage their previous "gelled" productivity.

So, to me it seems hypocritical for acquiring companies to value engineers so wildly differently, just based on how they are coming in the door.

Reward the Right People
-----------------------

I know it's a really tight market for talent, as there is a resource shortage of good engineers.

My admittedly selfish opinion is just that more of the money floating around should go to the resources that are actually in demand/shortage, the team/developers, and not line the pockets of founders/VCs who are going to go take another spin on the IPO wheel.

**Disclaimer:** Of course, I've never been through an acquihire, nor even live in the Bay Area, so all of my opinions are formed by [indirect sources](http://news.ycombinator.com). I welcome corrections if I'm being naive.

Especially on founder/VC compensation--if they are essentially wiped out, which is the result of a failed business venture in any other non-tech industry, then I don't think acquihires are as degenerate as I assume they are now.
