Bindgen 2.0 Released
====================

My hobby project [bindgen](http://github.com/stephenh/bindgen) just got a new release: 2.0.

bindgen provides expression language-like capabilities, but with type-safe method calls instead of opaque strings like OGNL.

Stateless Bindings
------------------

The biggest change is that bindings can now be stateless.

Previously, a binding could only be bound to 1 instance at a time, making them not safe for use across multiple threads. You could reuse them within a thread, with a `set(instance)`-based idiom like:

    FooBinding fb = new FooBinding();
    StringBinding nb = fb.name(); // could be more complex, e.g. fb.bar().name()
    
    Foo foo = new Foo("foo");
    fb.set(foo); // binds fb to the foo instance
    nb.get(); // returns "foo"
{: class=brush:java}

But the gap between `fb.set` and `nb.get()` meant another thread could step in and interleave a `set` behind your back.

Now there are `getWithRoot` and `setWithRoot` methods that are stateless and so thread-safe:

    FooBinding fb = new FooBinding();
    StringBinding nb = fb.name();
    
    Foo foo = new Foo("foo");
    nb.getWithRoot(foo); // returns "foo"
{: class=brush:java}

This means you can instantiate a binding just once and reuse it across many instances/threads.

[Joist](http://joist.ws) is starting to use these stateless bindings for its validation rules. The iterative nature (e.g. `foo.employer().name()`) of bindgen is more flexible than Joist's previous approach.
