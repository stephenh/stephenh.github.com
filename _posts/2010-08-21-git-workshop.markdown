git workshop
============

A few weeks ago I helped out with a git workshop at the [Omaha Dynamic Languages User Group](http://jays.net/wiki/ODynUG).

The format was a "hands on lab" where people installed git on their local machines and ran through a series of [canned scenarios](http://www.draconianoverlord.com/git-workshop.html) to introduce them to the various git commands. `add`, `diff`, `reset`, `merge`, `rebase`, etc.

Jay Hannah said a few members had suggested the lab format, and I think it went really well.

I have a tendency to try and explain things from the high/theoretical level, but sometimes it's better to just ignore that and simply use a tool or practice for awhile. Then after you have some experience and context to work from, the high/theoretical level is much easier to grasp.
