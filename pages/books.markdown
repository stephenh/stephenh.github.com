==============

Reading programming/technology books was fundamental to my development as a developer. Here are the ones I recommend.

Note that these are not "how to learn language XYZ", as those language-specific books are great for their purpose, but the books that stay on my shelf long-term are ones that apply to programming in general, and contain principles that apply to any language.

[The Pragmatic Programmer](http://a.co/3egf2bU) - One of the first "not language-specific" books I read. I need to re-read it so I can write a better summary, but it was my introduction to "programming as a craft" and very influential to me at the time.

[Clean Code](http://a.co/ef0h37T) - Good discussion of low-level mechanics of making code look nice, e.g. visual chunking of lines/statements. Unfortunately I read this late in my career, so it was kind of a "of course" read because the information was already obvious to me, but it's a great collection for newer programmers.

[Refactoring](http://a.co/cNawl8K) - Awesome set of patterns to make code incrementally better. Anything by Fowler is great.

[Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://a.co/ctBugwA) - While Gang of Four is the original/canonical pattern book, these patterns were, for me, much more relevant to modern/web-based programming (at least the server side), and so really made patterns "click" and I still use the terminology all the time.

[Domain-Driven Design](http://a.co/fZoRjjH) - I considered this my bible at one point; the concept of unified language, having programmers intimately understand the domain, etc. Great stuff. Tangentially, to me the term "Domain-Driven Design" almost got co-opted as implementation approach, e.g. especially in the .Net world, where you'd use a certain framework, or a certain set of patterns to make a "domain-driven design system"...but to me the point was always more about the concepts.

[Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests](http://a.co/iBkBQfC) - The design approach covered in this book very closely matches my own...role interfaces, etc. My only critique is that they love mocks, and mock everything almost without question (to me), where as I use a more judicious balance of mocks and stubs, e.g. 30% mocks and 70% stubs, depending on the system.

[Java Concurrency in Practice](http://a.co/9OlKduS) - For awhile this was my interview prep book...it covers JVM multi-threading very well, and is a great intro and refresher of the Java memory model. Which even if you don't code Java servers all day, is a great technical read in my opinion.
