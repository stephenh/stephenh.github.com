## Overview

Joist is an ActiveRecord-style, entity-based ORM for TypeScript.

Unlike the usual suspects of Prisma, Drizzle, etc., Joist embraces domain modeling & entities, providing more than just "please get my POJOs from the database" query builders, but a way to structure & organization your domain.

Joist was built to solve the day-to-day needs of our GraphQL monolith backend at [Homebound](https://www.homebound.com/), so its feature are all pragmatic "built to solve real problems", instead of coming from a VC-backed marketing-/hype-driven product roadmap whose true end goal is to monetize your usage.
