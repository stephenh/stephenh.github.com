## Overview

ts-proto is an older open source project, which grew out of my frustration with the circa-2018 "extremely not idiomatic" output of the official protobuf-js output, which was heavily skewed towards the ~decade old internal JavaScript style of Google.

Since driving a few projects at [Remind](https://www.remind.com/), ts-proto has grown to have "an obscene number of knobs", which generally reflects the disarray of the protobuf ecosystem, where everyone invariably ends up having their own flavor, and own opinions, about how to build their RPC stack.
