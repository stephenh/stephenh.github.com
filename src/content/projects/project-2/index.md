![Astro Nano](/astro-nano.png)

Astro Nano is a static, minimalist, lightweight, lightning fast portfolio and blog theme.

Built with Astro, Tailwind and Typescript, and no frameworks.

It was designed as an even more minimal theme than Mark Horn's popular theme [Astro Sphere](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-sphere)
