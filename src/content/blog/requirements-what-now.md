### Context

One of my frequent self-criticisms is that I've been doing software long enough, that I should have "figured everything out by now". Granted, not at running ~100-1000/whatever person engineering orgs, but surely for the stereotypical ~50 person cross-functional tech org.

Within my eng individual contributor (IC) niche of building "enterprise spreadsheets" (non-AI, non-ML, non-crypto information-management systems), I feel pretty competent at what I do.

But in terms of "how cross-functional team(s) of eng + PM + UX that collaborative effectively & deliver quickly", it still seems like alchemy.

## Requirements

In particular, I see requirements as always a struggle for cross-functional teams. As in, I don't know that I've ever observed them being done so obviously right that I could say "this is how it should be done" and then always just do that going forward.

"Requirements" can take a large spectrum of forms, from the: 

* Extremely large, now-infamous 40-page PRD doc that is super-detailed but a) takes forever to draft, b) no one reads, and c) quickly becomes out of date
* Extremely small, like ~4-5 bullet points of acceptance criteria (AC) on the handful of stories in an epic

And, of course, hopefully the goldilocks zone in between, assuming it actually exists. :-)

## Scenarios


## Mocks

What I think does work well, and nearly everyone does, is delivery of Figmas/mocks to engineers, and have engineers deliver from mocks.

I think that engineers appreciate the concrete-ness and clarify at least of elements that go on the screen, albeit mocks often don't capture the "flow" of the app.

But what seems like the biggest struggle is not mocks -> code, it is requirements -> mocks.

The general thing seems to be:

* PMs don't want to tell UX what to do
  * Nor does UX want to be told what to do
* PMs know no one wants a 40 page PRD
* UX is basically left to their own devices to trial a best-guess set of mocks
* However, because the majority of UX engineers are not technical enough to intuit what really needs to happen, this a) takes them a long time, and b) their mocks are a best guess 
* Then PM/eng/UX sit in a room and try to walk the mocks to something that will work
* Which is fine, and could even be great, but
  * a) because the mocks are not wireframes, only UX can make changes
  * b) because the mocks are not wireframes, the UX has emotional attachment to them
